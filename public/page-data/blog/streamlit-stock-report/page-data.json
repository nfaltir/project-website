Research a stock. The project was simple but it was too time consuming. It involves a lot of Wikipedia searches, 30+ opened tabs on the Yahoo Finance webpage, An opened PDF of the target stockâ€™s latest quarterly report, and an excel spread sheet with rows (1000+) of data. It was manageable, but the risk of human error is high. You are manually importing data from different data sources, and your workflow is overcomplicated. Building a system that catches these error adds more time and the process is not automated. Enters Streamlit ðŸ˜Ž</p>\n<p>Today, using Streamlit powered by Python you can research a stock in less than 1-2 minutes. Streamlit is an open-source python framework that builds your python code into a clean web application. That means no HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Using streamlit with yfinance and pandas I was able to query data from Yahoo Finance to display a dashboard that contains all the data metrics that I want.</p>","timeToRead":1}},"tags":["python","API"],"description":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"excerpt":"Build a stock report web application with streamlit and python."}}},"previous":null,"next":{"slug":"fastapi-and-mkdocs","title":"FastAPI and MkDocs"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"streamlit-stock-report","previousPostSlug":null,"nextPostSlug":"fastapi-and-mkdocs"}},
